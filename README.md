# Runner_Godot

This runner made with the Game engine Godot was made in one day for some cr√©dits at Epitech and for myself teaching me Godot.  
You can already test it in windows or Linux with the executables : "Build_Linux.86_64" or "Build_Windows.exe" at the projetcs root.  
It's a try and retry game pretty funny to test with an basic IA.  
  
Thanks for your attention,  
It will be a pleasure if you STAR my project if you found my game funny.
